                            again awaited a legendary performance by the great Usain Bolt. It came time for the 4 x 100 meter relay and bolt was 
                            running anchor. When he recieved the baton his team was a few strides ahead of the second place team but then disaster 
                            struck. Just a few seconds into his race, Bolt tore a tendon in his left hamsting causing him to collape on the track. 
                            It was truly a sad sight to see a world renowned runner go out like this in his last race. Bolt continues to be admired 
                            as one of the greatest athletes of all time but seeing this race was heartbreaking.

                            apparently trying to fulfill a childhood dream. He played for the central coast mariners in Australia. His 
                            speed was challenging for defenders to counter and bolt even scored 2 goals in his short career. Bolt eventually 
                            left the team saying it just wasn't right for him but that it was fun while it lasted.  </p></div>
