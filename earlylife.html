                                    Usian bolt was born on 21 August 1986 in the parish of Trelawny in North-West Jamaica. As a young child in Jamaica, 
                                    Bolt loved sports almost more than anything. He was at first more interested in other sports like cricket and football 
                                    than he was in track. His speed was apparent from a young age as he was quickly dubbed the fastest kid in his middle school.
                                     When Bolt reached highschool, he was still playing cricket as his main sport but upon noticing his speed, his cricket 
                                     coach suggested he try track and field. During his highschool career bolt was noticed by former olympian Pablo McNeil and 
                                     he took bolt under his wing. At just 15 years old he finished second in the 2001 William Knibb High School national 
                                     championships with a 200m time of 22.04 seconds. His place among the best athletes in the world was established 
                                     when he became the youngest ever world junior champion in the 200 meter at just 16 years old. It was now clear Bolt was 
                                     something special and somone to look out for in the future
